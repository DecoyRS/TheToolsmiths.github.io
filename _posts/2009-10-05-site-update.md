Hello! Â I am happy to announce that our humble blog has just moved over to a new host (from WordPress.com) and is sporting a shiny new domain name [thetoolsmiths.org](http://thetoolsmiths.org)! Â This opens the door to adding new content to the blog with plugins (polls, etc&#8230;) as well as making it possible to add new features besides the blog (job board anyone?).

Do you have an idea of something that would be handy? Â Drop us a line or leave a comment and tell us what is on your mind!

Right as the site was updating there were some posts, so make sure you didn&#8217;t miss them:

  * [Building on the Cloud](http://thetoolsmiths.org/2009/10/05/building-on-the-cloud/)
  * [Playing with Prototyping Tools](http://thetoolsmiths.org/2009/09/27/playing-with-prototyping-tools/)

Cheers and keep making great tools, folks&#8230; Â ðŸ™‚
