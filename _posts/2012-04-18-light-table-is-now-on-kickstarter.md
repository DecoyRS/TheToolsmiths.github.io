[Chris Granger](http://www.chris-granger.com/)&#8216;s [Light Table](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/) was originally a concept video for a dynamic language IDE that extends concepts by [Bret Victor](http://thetoolsmiths.org/2012/04/12/bret-victor-inventing-on-principle/) about how to make the coding experience more focused and integrated with the final product. 

The project is now on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/306316578/light-table), and its looking for $200k in funding to build an open source IDE for Clojure and Javascript. If they reach $300k they are going to build plug-in support for Python , too. Very exciting stuff!
