Hi all,

My name is Richard Rabil, and I&#8217;m a recent student member of IGDA and a participant in the Writing and Tools SIGs. I&#8217;d like to invite you to take a short, anonymous survey I&#8217;m conducting on software tools for interactive storytelling.

Ultimately, my goal is to evaluate a set of authoring tools for interactive storytelling and develop a report that can help people determine which software tool is best suited to their situation. Data from the survey will help me better understand game writers&#8217; or designers&#8217; preferences, and assign weightings to my evaluation criteria. This project will also count toward my graduate research.

Although the survey is geared towards game writing, I think it will be important to get a wide variety of perspectives from people who work in the industry. So even if you&#8217;re not a game writer, your input will still be valuable since you will likely have fresh insights from other aspects of the game development process.

You can access the survey here: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Esurveymonkey%2Ecom%2Fs%2F2Y5MD6B&urlhash=nCez&_t=tracking_anet" rel="nofollow" target="blank">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2Y5MD6B</a>. It will be open between now and November 21st.

When I finish writing my report in mid-December, you’ll be able to download your own free copy at the following URL: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdialoguejunkie%2Ecom%2F2011%2F10%2F29%2Fsurvey-results&urlhash=4E1R&_t=tracking_anet" rel="nofollow" target="blank">http://dialoguejunkie.com/2011/10/29/survey-results</a>.

If you have any questions, let me know! I hope you&#8217;ll consider participating and help me spread the word. The more honest input I receive, the more I believe the report will benefit the gaming industry.

Cheers,
  
Richard Rabil
