The IGDA Tools SIG is proud to announce that we are relaunching the IGDA Tools blog with new authors, new technology, and a new name, The Toolsmiths!  Along with a new design, we have enlisted the help of 3 new authors, all of which have a very clear opinion on game industry tools.  All of us are hoping that we&#8217;ll be able to make this blog a great place for commentary on the current state of tools in the industry, a breeding ground for distributing ideas, a test bed for new technology, and a soap box from which we can improve the industry (through tools, of course).

So without further ado, our new authors are:

  * Me, Jeff Ward, Lead Architect, Orbus Gameworks
  * Geoff Evans, Senior Tools Programmer, Insomniac Games
  * Dan Goodman, Founder, Robotic Arm Software

I&#8217;ve asked that each do a blog post over the next week to introduce themselves and give you a post on something they&#8217;re currently interested in. <span></span>If you have ideas for things you&#8217;d like addressed on the blog, please feel free to comment, or send any one of us an email.

Enjoy the new blog!
