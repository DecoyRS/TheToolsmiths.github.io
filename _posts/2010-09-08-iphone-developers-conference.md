Are you knee deep in iOS programming? Perhaps looking to get your feet wet? If so, the generous folks at the [iPhone Developers Conference](http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphonefall2010/) (happening next month in Philadelphia) sent along a free pass to one of our readers. To enter the drawing send us an [email](mailto:contest@thetoolsmiths.org) explaining what your favorite game development tool is a why. We will pick one at random, and entries must be sent by the end of day Wednesday, September 8th.

Even if you aren&#8217;t the winner of the drawing, you can still save $100 off the conference fee by providing priority code PHBLOGS when registering. Register by September 10th (this Friday) and save a total of $300 as this $100 discount can be combined with early bird pricing.
