There are four tools-centric roundtables at GDC this year. As always, there is a Technical Issues in Tools roundtable each day of the main conference, but this year there is dedicated roundtable to discuss Tools SIG issues! Plan on making it to at least one of the Technical Issues in Tools roundtables, and **make sure to come and check out the SIG Roundtable on Friday!** New projects are afoot in the Tools SIG, and we need your help to push for more sharing in the tools community!

Here are the session times:

**Wednesday 3/19**:
  
Technical Issues in Tools at 11am

**Thursday 3/20**:
  
Technical Issues in Tools at 5:30pm

**Friday 3/21**:
  
Technical Issues in Tools at 10am
  
Tools SIG Roundtable at 4pm
