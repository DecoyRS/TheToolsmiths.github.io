For those that don&#8217;t already know, my company has put together a game development tools survey.  This survey has been up since the end of last year.  It&#8217;s different from  Mark DeLoura&#8217;s survey, as ours focuses more on the attitudes and issues related to internally developed tools as well as middleware.  I believe that once we know the issues that developers are facing and make them public, we&#8217;ll be able to make improvements.  Our current plan is to end this survey in April and release the results.  What we&#8217;ve seen so far is pretty telling, but I won&#8217;t give away our preliminary results yet.  We still need more game devloper opinions, so please  take the game development tools survey here:
