Here is an interesting video of the tools Eskil Steenberg has engineered for his game [Love](http://www.quelsolaar.com/love/index.html):

His integration with [Uni-Verse](http://uni-verse.org/) is definitely an interesting take on what life as a content creator could be like without having to deal with load/save/export via files on disk. Verse seems to disconnect where data is stored and how its managed from the user. It comes across to me as fitting the client/server paradigm of the web into content creation tools for games.
