In February, Mark DeLoura put up a survey on game engines, which we posted and [posted his subsequent results](http://toolssig.wordpress.com/2009/03/06/engine-survey-results/).  Well, he&#8217;s doing it again and I&#8217;m sure has refined the survey a bit to answer some of the questions raised by his original survey.  This new survey is available [here](http://ow.ly/eYiY) and we&#8217;re asking the Toolsmiths readers to take part if they haven&#8217;t already, and we&#8217;ll be sure to post the results as soon as they&#8217;re available.
