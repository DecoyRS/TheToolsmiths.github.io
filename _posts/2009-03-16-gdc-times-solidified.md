We&#8217;re just one week away from GDC and the times for most of the talks have been solidified. The links in my [previous post](http://toolssig.wordpress.com/2009/02/03/a-preview-of-gdc/) will be able to tell you where and when to catch some tools related talks. This includes our official Tools SIG Round Table, which I will be moderating. Note that, while the time on the site is correct, the round table was originally scheduled at a different time, so the time in the program may be wrong.

REPEAT! THE TIME IN THE GDC PROGRAM FOR THE TOOLS SIG ROUND TABLE MAY BE WRONG!!! And will be corrected in the addendum. THE TIME ON THE WEB SITE IS CORRECT!!!

I encourage all of our readers that will be attending GDC to attend this round table. The discussions we have there will (hopefully) set the tone for SIG business for the coming year and get us all on the &#8220;same page&#8221; in terms of where we want the SIG to go, what projects we want to do, and how we plan to move those projects forward. This includes new blog authors and features. If you are unable to make the roundtable, but would like to suggest a topic of discussion or volunteer to be part of a project, please feel free to comment.

As a note, I will be sure to post notes of the round table (and other tools related talks) on our [wiki page](http://www.igda.org/wiki/Tools_SIG) after GDC.

Hope to see everyone there!
