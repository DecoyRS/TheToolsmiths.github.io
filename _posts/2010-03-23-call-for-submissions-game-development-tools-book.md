I thought I would bring to the community&#8217;s attention this new book on Game Development Tools that&#8217;s looking for submissions.  Here&#8217;s the call:

> We invite you to submit a proposal for an innovative article to be included in a forthcoming book, Game Development Tools, which will be edited by Marwan Y. Ansari and published by A. K. Peters. We expect to publish the volume in time for GDC 2011.
> 
> We are open to any tools articles that you feel would make a valuable contribution to this book.
> 
> Some topics that would be of interest include:
> 
>   * Content Pipeline tools (creation, streamlining, management)
>   * Graphics/Rendering tools
>   * Profiling tools
>   * Collada import/export/inspection
>   * Sound tools
>   * In-Game debugging tools
>   * Memory management & analysis
>   * Console tools (single and cross platform)
> 
> This list is not meant to be exclusive and other topics are welcome.
> 
> The schedule for the book is as follows:
> 
> June 30th &#8211; All proposals in.

Regardless of whether Toolsmiths readers get into the book, it sounds like it could be great.
