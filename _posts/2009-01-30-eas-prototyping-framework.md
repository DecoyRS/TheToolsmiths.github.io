This is news to me. Apparently EA has release one of its prototyping GameJam frameworks to the public on Google Code. The framework (called Angel) is available here:
  
<http://code.google.com/p/angel-engine/>

From the site:

> Angel was originally made by a group of employees at Electronic Arts Los Angeles for use in a GameJam they were planning for April of 2008. The source was opened in January 2009.
> 
> Angel provides:
> 
>   * Actors (game objects with color, shape, responses, attributes, etc.)
>   * Texturing with Transparency
>   * &#8220;Animations&#8221; (texture swapping at defined intervals)
>   * Rigid-Body Physics 
>       * A clever programmer can do soft-body physics with it
>   * Sound (.wav only)
>   * Text Rendering with multiple fonts
>   * Particle Systems
>   * Some basic AI (state machine and pathfinding)
>   * Config File Processing
>   * Input from a mouse, keyboard, or XBox 360 controller 
>       * Binding inputs from a config file
>   * Tuning Variables that write out to a config file
>   * In-Game Console
>   * Logging

It should be noted that Angel is not a framework for beginning programmers.Â  Again, from the site:

> Angel is designed for experienced engineers. That doesn&#8217;t mean that it uses all sorts of crazy programming techniques or is difficult to use (quite the opposite: see #1), but nor does it hold the developer&#8217;s hand very much. It&#8217;s expected that a developer has at least some experience exploring a codebase to see how it works.

I think this is fine for a prototyping framework, as they&#8217;re made to get &#8220;out of the way&#8221; so that a programmer can do exactly what they want quickly.

I look at prototyping frameworks as one of the key tools a company can provide to programmers. It allows them to quickly and easily investigate a new system in your game without having to go through the complicated mess of your engine (and, yes, regardless of how awesome your engine is, it&#8217;s still a complicated mess). In my mind, this is a big thing, and I hope it continues to evolve over the next few years.
