GDC gets closer every day.  This year, instead of doing an official IGDA roundtable to talk SIG business, we&#8217;ve decided to just get together for beers at a local bar.  The location and time is yet to be determined, but I would like to find out what night the membership / readers would prefer.

So please take a moment to visit the site and respond to the poll in this post to let us know when you&#8217;d most like to gather, and we&#8217;ll see you at GDC!
