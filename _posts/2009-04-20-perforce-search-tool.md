Today, we have an interesting tool writen by Toolsmiths reader Eddie Schooltz.Â  The tool, which he [wrote about on his blog](http://www.eddiescholtz.com/blog/archives/99), is for searching for Perforce change sets, and I can see how it would be incredibly useful (provided you have good changelist descriptions) when searching for when things changed.

Eddie says he&#8217;ll be posting the source to the tool, and we&#8217;ll keep you updated about when that happens.
