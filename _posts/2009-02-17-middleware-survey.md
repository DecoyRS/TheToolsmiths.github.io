Mark DeLoura, probably known most famously as the creator of the excellent book series Game Programming Gems, is [conducting a survey](http://www.satori.org/2009/02/on_game_engine_middleware.html) on game industry middleware.  And what is middleware than one giant tool right? From his blog post:

> After some discussions with game engine middleware manufacturers, I decided to post a couple of surveys to see if I could get the pulse of what game developers are thinking.

There are two different surveys, one for technologists and one for producers, and I encourage everyone to go over and give Mark a piece of your mind.  Or at least some data for him to work with.

On a somewhat unrelated note, the Tools SIG will probably run it&#8217;s own survey in the future, and it will be one of the things on the table at the GDC talk next month.
