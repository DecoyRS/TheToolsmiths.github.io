The IGDA has opened nominations for the Board.  From the newsletter that went out to IGDA members:

> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">As we approach the start of 2010, it is time for us to begin the process of electing new representatives to our IGDA Board of Directors.  These are the people who will be adding their voices to the decision making aspects of your association and choosing the direction for the organization to follow for years to come.  Each of these individuals gives of their time and energy to move the association forward in the direction they feel most represents the will of the membership and the good of the association.</span>

The link to nominate Board members is here: <http://www.igda.org/elections/nomination-packet> Note that you have to be an IGDA member to nominate a Board member, and you must be nominating another IGDA member.  (We recommend you be one anyway, and please note in your membership profile that you are a member of the Tools SIG)

It&#8217;s important to remember that the Board affects how the IGDA is run, and in many ways, it is the public face of the IGDA.  In some people&#8217;s eyes, the IGDA had a huge problem with public relations last year, partially because of the positions and actions of some of its board members.  This is your opportunity to make sure that developers that you respect get on the board and represent your interests, so please do not skip out.
