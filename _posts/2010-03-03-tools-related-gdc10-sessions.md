First off, our official Tools SIG gathering at GDC is on Thursday 1:30 to 2:30 at the IGDA booth.

Everyone should also show up to at least one of John Walker&#8217;s excellent roundtables. I find them useful to see what approaches people are using in their pipelines and share lessons learned from the past year.
