The IGDA Tools SIG has opened voting for the new SIG chair!  The new chair will replace the wonderful and talented Raquel Bujans, who&#8217;s been heading up the SIG for the past 2 years and has recently elected to step down.

We have three &#8220;sets&#8221; of candidates looking at taking the roll of chair:

  * Jeff Ward (me)
  * Kevin Rabun & Alan Kimball (as co-chairs)
  * Casey O&#8217;Donnell

Please head over to vote [here](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=waU2Cn1jjR1lvGZUqb_2falA_3d_3d).  The password for voting can be obtained from the email sent to the discussion list (see [here](http://toolssig.wordpress.com/discussion-list/) for instructions on how to join) or you can email Raquel directly (instructions on the survey page).

Good luck to everyone!
