The IGDA Tools SIG has a new discussion group! We&#8217;re moving from using the IGDA hosted Mailman group (called Tools-Discuss) to a Google Group called [The Toolsmiths](http://groups.google.com/group/the-toolsmiths).

The purpose of the group is to provide a discussion forum for all <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">types of game tools development, from command line tools, to UI-focused tools, and middleware applications. This can include things like best practices in version control, building and build servers, exporters, level editors, deployment scripts, and game to tools integration. Basically, if you do it as a tools developer, we want to hear about it, and discuss it with you.</span>

<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">See you on the list!</span>
