Besides our discussion list, the Tools SIG has many other ways for you to stay connected with other tools devotees, including a [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=30932709234), a [Facebook blog network](http://apps.facebook.com/blognetworks/blog/the_toolsmiths/) group and now the new [LinkedIn group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1814086&trk=hb_side_g). If you are a member of any of these sites, please feel free to join and connect with everyone else!

If you would like the SIG to have a presence on any other sites, please let us know, and we&#8217;ll look into it.
