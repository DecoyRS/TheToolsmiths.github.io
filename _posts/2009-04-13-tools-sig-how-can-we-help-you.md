At GDC, we got a lot of good ideas on what people expect from the Tools SIG in the comming year(s), but I want to ask the blog readership what they think, to make sure we&#8217;re focusing our efforts on the projects that will not only give the most back to the community, but expand our reach to new members.   To that end, I&#8217;ve included in this post two polls figure out where to focus our efforts.  If you are in an RSS reader and can&#8217;t see the polls, please take a moment to visit our site and respond.  Your responces will help shape the SIGs efforts in the comming year.
