Surprise! The Toolsmiths is happy to announce we are starting a podcast! It’s hosted by Geoff Evans (SIG Chair and engineer at Kojima Productions), and David Lightbown (UX Director at Ubisoft Montreal). Our first guest is [Dan Goodman](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dangoodman) from [Robotic Arm Software](http://www.roboticarmsoftware.com/).

Pardon any echoes that may have found their way into this episode, we are still learning the ropes of making great sounding podcast audio.
