#### What is it?
It is not easy to find time/motivation to watch good GDC Vault videos. The Toolsmiths community decided to form a sort of "book club" for GDC Vault Talks called "Vault Club".

<hr>

#### How does it work?
We pick a Vault talk, watch it on our own time, then pick a time/date to discuss it in the [#Vault_Club channel](https://thetoolsmiths.slack.com).
