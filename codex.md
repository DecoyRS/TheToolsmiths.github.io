# The Toolsmiths Codex

The Tools SIG codex is a warehouse of information that is constantly curated by the SIG to hold reference information about best practices in tools. These topics are perennial at the Technical Issues in Tools roundtables at GDC, and by having this information available on the website we can focus more attention to trends and changes in the state of the art instead of calling out known solutions.

Also, the codex is an excellent resource to link to tools related lectures available on the GDC Vault, Twitch, Youtube, etc…
