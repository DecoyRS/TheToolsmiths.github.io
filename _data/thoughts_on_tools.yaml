  quote : I kind of think about it as natural evolution. You know there are some species that have evolved a certain way and they're in a certain environment and they've died off. The same thing goes with certain types of software and interactions. If an interaction is difficult to use or many interactions are difficult to use that software might not have as much success being adapted and being used by people and then it dies off. And the ones that have more easier interactions are going to survive and other people are going to look at those and evolve themselves off of those.

  quote : "When designing some feature (especially one with UI), I find that these can be useful questions to be asking: What widely-used software already does this kind of thing? What software does it really well? What does the state of the art look like?"
